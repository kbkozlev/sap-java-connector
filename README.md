# SAP Java GUI Connection Configurator

People using SAP GUI on Linux or Mac know that they have to use the Java GUI.
The Java GUI is different from the Windows GUI in that you have to use connection strings in order to connect to the servers.
This is often times difficult to assemble as the parameters are not always known.
In order to make things simpler I build this website that will construct the string for you.
